# Scanpay for Thirty Bees

We have developed an official payment module for [Thirty Bees](https://thirtybees.com/). The module allows you to accept payments in your Thirty Bees store via our [API](https://docs.scanpay.dk/). We support and maintain the module, but we encourage you to help us improve the module. Feedback, bug reports and code contributions are much appreciated.

You can always e-mail us at [help@scanpay.dk](mailto:help@scanpay.dk) or chat with us on IRC at libera.chat #scanpay ([webchat](https://web.libera.chat/#scanpay)).
